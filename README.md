# Wireshark Network Protocol Analysis Project

## üìå Business Case
Understanding network protocols and traffic behavior is essential for diagnosing performance issues, detecting anomalies, and strengthening cybersecurity. This project uses Wireshark to capture, analyze, and interpret network packets in real-time and offline environments.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives
- Capture and analyze live network traffic using Wireshark
- Identify and interpret key protocols (e.g., TCP, HTTP, DNS, ICMP)
- Detect anomalies, unencrypted data, and suspicious behavior
- Build foundational skills in packet analysis and network troubleshooting

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow

1. **Initiate Project**
   - Define scope: protocols to analyze, traffic types, capture duration
   - Set up lab environment or select target network interface

2. **Capture Network Traffic**
   - Launch Wireshark and select appropriate interface (e.g., Ethernet, Wi-Fi)
   - Apply capture filters if needed (e.g., `tcp port 80`)
   - Save captured traffic as `.pcap` files

3. **Protocol Filtering & Inspection**
   - Use display filters (e.g., `http`, `dns`, `icmp`) to isolate traffic
   - Inspect packet headers and payloads
   - Reassemble TCP streams to view full conversations

4. **Traffic Analysis**
   - Identify handshake sequences (e.g., TCP 3-way handshake)
   - Detect retransmissions, malformed packets, or latency issues
   - Analyze DNS queries, HTTP requests, and SSL/TLS handshakes

5. **Anomaly Detection**
   - Look for suspicious IPs, ports, or payloads
   - Identify unencrypted credentials or data leaks
   - Flag unusual traffic patterns (e.g., port scans, beaconing)

6. **Reporting**
   - Summarize findings with screenshots and packet references
   - Highlight protocol behaviors, anomalies, and lessons learned
   - Recommend mitigation or optimization steps if applicable

7. **Documentation & Archiving**
   - Store `.pcap` files, filter expressions, and analysis notes
   - Maintain a knowledge base of protocol behaviors and signatures

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use capture filters to reduce noise and file size
- Label and timestamp all captures for traceability
- Avoid capturing sensitive data on production networks
- Use color rules in Wireshark to highlight key protocols
- Regularly update Wireshark to support new protocol dissectors
- Practice in a lab before analyzing live enterprise traffic

## üìã Project Management Tips

- Define clear learning goals (e.g., ‚ÄúUnderstand TCP flags‚Äù or ‚ÄúDetect DNS tunneling‚Äù)
- Track analysis progress using a checklist or Kanban board
- Schedule review sessions to discuss findings with peers or mentors
- Align project with certifications (e.g., CompTIA Network+, CEH, PCAP)

---

## üìé Sample Use Cases

- Capture HTTP traffic to observe GET/POST requests
- Analyze DNS resolution for a suspicious domain
- Reconstruct a file transfer over FTP or HTTP
- Detect ICMP ping sweeps or traceroute behavior
- Observe TLS handshake and certificate exchange
